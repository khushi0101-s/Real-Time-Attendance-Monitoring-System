# Smart Attendance System (Android App)

**General introduction**
This project is a straightforward application in mobile form, aimed to improve student attendance tracking and security of this process to students and instructors. This replaces the current traditional means which allow attendance marks to be given through hands or can even be manipulated easily. With this, students must have to be present in location using the gps to check-in for attendance mark.

The following comprises the attendance system:
1.Mobile application for student (this project)
2.Teacher's system for monitor attendance
3.Back-end server which also holds the database

**Why this project?**
There are quite a number of institutes where the systems of marking attendance is still manual or is prone to malpractice. The attendance could be marked proxy, it is time consuming and hectic to manage the records.

This project attempts to eliminate the problems, with the usage of location based verification that allows attendance to be marked only when the student is physically present.

**Problem Solution:**
The application will be such that the students can check in only when they are physically present at the location where attendance check is being performed. The system will authenticate the user and the location of the user before permitting him/her to check in.

Features:
   1.Secure student login system
   2.Location-based attendance marking
   3.Real-time attendance recording
   4.User-friendly mobile application interface
   5.Backend database connection

**Technologies Used**
Java (Android Development)
Android SDK
GPS / Location Services
MySQL (Backend Database)
PHP (Server-side integration)
